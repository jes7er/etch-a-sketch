This project is an etch-a-sketch simulator that is being completed as part of the ODIN project curriculum.

COMPLETED:

1.  Project starts with a 16x16 grid of square divs made using CSS Grid and javascript.

2. mouseover changes divs color based off color picker value.

3. Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now youâ€™ve got a new sketch pad.

4. Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when one is clicked.

5. Generate random RGB coloring for every mousedown event.  I am using David Merfield's randomColor.js to help provide better coloring options with the random function.  More information can be found at https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor

6. Incorporate opacity to have each pass add 10% of selected color so that only after 10 passes is the square completely opaque.
